    <p class="p">Dear Reader,
        My name is William Shipe and I'am (was) student of Texas Wesleyan. Just like you I've gone through the computer science program. I first went to Tarrant County College then transfered to Wesleyan. I'm should also preface that I served in the U.S Army for eight years. There are many fields and neiche aspects of of this degree we've chosen. I don't know where or what I'll do with it in my future. Nor do I know you'll do with your degree but I do wish you success.</p>
